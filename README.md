# AQ Heist — Visualising Air Pollution Costs in “Louvre Heists”

[Live demo](https://aqheist.lovable.app/) • Built with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)

## 🎯 What it is  
AQ Heist is a web app that converts the **annual cost of outdoor air pollution-related health damages** in each country into a quirky unit: the value of the October 2025 Heist at the Louvre Museum. It also shows the real-time accumulating estimated economic damage due to outdoor air pollution by country and globally.


## Why I did it  
Air-pollution health damages are massive but hard to grasp. By translating them into a familiar narrative unit (“a Louvre heist”), we help make the scale **visually impactful** and easier to communicate.

## Data source  
- The annual cost figures come from the World Bank Report *[Air Pollution and Health  Table A.3](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/c96ee144-4a4b-5164-ad79-74c051179eee)”*.
